*** command-key-description
=(command-key-description CMD &optional KEYMAPS SEP)=

Return description of key-sequence for CMD.
The KEYMAPS can be a single keymap/variable or list of keymaps/variables to search for CMD,
otherwise =overriding-local-map= is searched.
By default the first keybinding will be returned, but if SEP is supplied it will be used
to seperate the descriptions of all key-sequences bound to CMD.
If there is no key-sequence for command then a string in the form "M-x CMD" will be returned.

*** eval-keymap
=(eval-keymap KEYMAP)=

Return the keymap pointed to by KEYMAP, or KEYMAP itself if it is a keymap.

*** keymaps-in-file
=(keymaps-in-file FILE &optional EVAL)=

Return a list of keymaps and variables pointing to keymaps that are used in FILE.
If EVAL is non-nil eval any variables in the returned list.
